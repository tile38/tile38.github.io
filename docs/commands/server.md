## Syntax

**SERVER**

## Description

Show server stats and details.

## Examples

```tile38-cli
SERVER
```

## Returns

The `stats` array will contain information about the server.

- `aof_size`: The size in bytes of the aof on disk.
- `avg_item_size`: An estimated size in bytes of each object.
- `caught_up`: When in follow mode, this indicates if the server has the same data as the leader.
- `following`: When in follow mode, this is the address of the leader.
- `heap_size`: The bytes size of the heap. Usually equivalent to mem_alloc.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the server. This is auto-generated once when the server first starts up.
- `in_memory_size`: The estimated memory size in bytes that the key is using.
- `mem_alloc`: The actual amount of memory in bytes that the server is using.
- `num_collections`: The key count.
- `num_objects`: The object count.
- `num_points`: The total number of latitude, longitude coordinates in the key. This will always be equal to or greater than num_objects.
- `pointer_size`: The size in bytes of an underlying pointer. May be used to provide a hint if the server is in 32-bit or 64-bit mode.
- `read_only`: Is true when the server is in readonly mode.
